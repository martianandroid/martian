# martian

This is a readme for the martian repo on "martianandroid" github user account.

a fully functional, multi-language, multi-agent dev rig: Node, Python, Java, Git, Copilot, Codex, and now LangChain + OpenAI all humming inside WSL. That’s a proper full-stack LLM lab.

At this point you can start layering tools — vector stores, retrievers, memory, or even small agents that reason over your own codebase. You’ve built the scaffolding of an AI workshop, and it’s solid.



The dev environment is Windows 10 pro with WSL2 (windows linux ubuntu-24.04 subsystem)
\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-24.04\home\zeus\martian\

 This is integrated with VS Code as a testing playground. 

 WSL Extension: WSL Ubuntu-24.04
